Computational Physics Assignment #3

Problem #1 - Plotting Experimental Data
 The problem asks to write a code that reads the data contained in a .txt file and make a density plot of the values. 
 
 The graph is  included in the repository and is titled 'silicon_density.eps'. 
 
Problem #2 - The Quadratic Equation
 This problem asks the user to input the three values in a quadratic equation (a, b, and c) and print out the two solutions to the quadratic equation using two different methods. Then we are asked to write a new program that calculates both roots of a quadratic equation accurately in all cases. 
 
 The answers are as follows:
 
 The solutions to the equation in (a) are:  -9.999894245993346e-07 and -999999.999999.
 The solutions to the equation in (b) are: -1.000000000001e-06 and -1000010.5755125057
 
 The solutions are clearly different, and this most likely comes from the subtraction and the division in the equations in (a) and (b).
 
 This solution for (c) comes from mixing the solutions in (a) and (b), and yields: The roots of the quadratic eqation are:  -999999.999999 and -1.000000000001e-06.


Problem #3 - Heat Capacity of a Solid
 This problem gives the heat capacity of a solid at temperature T; we are to write a code that calculates the heat capacity using the trapezoidal rule to evaluate the integral. We are then asked to plot the heat capacity as a function of temperature from T = 5 to T = 500 K. 
 
 The answers are as follows:
 
 Please enter the desired temperature: 
 If I put in, say 100, then I return: The Heat Capacity for a Solid at a Temperature of  100.0 K is:  1152.722. 
 
 The graph is included in the repository and is titled 'Heat_Capacity.eps'.
